1. First look up ~/.ssh/config file formats. 
**The ~/.ssh directory is automatically created when the user runs the ssh command for the first time. In its simplest form, it contains one or more entries with the remote user name, hostname, and port. For example: 

john@dev.example.com -p 2322 

Copy and enter that information at the top of the Rofi screen after the "ssh"

2. If the connection has a password you will next need to enter it, unless you have set that up in ~/.ssh/config
