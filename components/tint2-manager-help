Tint2 config files must be in $TINT2PATH, set by default to $HOME/.config/tint2/
-----------------------------------

When the dialog opens, any running tint2s will be checkmarked.

Click "Apply" and all running tint2s are stopped, and all checkmarked tint2s are started.

To stop a tint2 just uncheck it, and "Apply".

Selected running tint2s are saved to a session file in $TINT2PATH, and can be run with the "tint2session" script. To start them at login, the following line within the startup file would be used:

           tint2session

To edit a tint2 config in text format, this command can be used to launch a selection gui:

           tint2edit
